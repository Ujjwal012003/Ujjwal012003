# 🙏🏻 Namaskar, I'm Ujjwal Bhardwaj 

A Data Scientist and AI Developer passionate about transforming complex data into intelligent, user-centric applications. With a foundation in both front-end and back-end development, I specialize in creating end-to-end solutions—from robust data pipelines and machine learning models to interactive web platforms and 3D simulations.

Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology at **I.K.G Punjab Technical University**, I am driven to build efficient, scalable, and impactful technology.

## 🚀 What I Do

* **AI & RAG Systems:** I architect production-grade AI systems for intelligent knowledge retrieval and generation. Built enterprise-scale RAG pipeline processing 26 NCERT textbooks with 5,661 entities using LightRAG, vector embeddings, and hybrid semantic search. Developed agentic AI pipelines using LangChain and CrewAI for autonomous workflow orchestration. Additional work includes medical anomaly detection platform achieving 95% accuracy with XGBoost and OpenCV.

* **Advanced ML & NLP:** I specialize in multimodal content processing and knowledge graph construction. Engineered production pipelines with RAG-Anything framework and MinerU parser for extracting text, images, tables, and equations from documents. Integrated OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for context-aware question-answering across 1,000+ indexed chunks with GPU-accelerated processing on RunPod infrastructure.

* **Full-Stack & 3D Web Development:** I create responsive and intuitive user interfaces with modern frameworks. Experience building full-stack applications with Flask and React, and developing engaging virtual environments with Three.js to visualize complex educational concepts in immersive 3D simulations.

* **Data Visualization & Automation:** I specialize in turning raw data into actionable insights. Built automated data pipelines for 10,000+ records, developed 10+ dynamic dashboards using Matplotlib and Chart.js, and automated data preprocessing reducing manual effort by 30%.
