# üôèüèª Namaskar, I'm Ujjwal Bhardwaj 

A Data Scientist and AI Developer passionate about transforming complex data into intelligent, user-centric applications. With a foundation in both front-end and back-end development, I specialize in creating end-to-end solutions‚Äîfrom robust data pipelines and machine learning models to interactive web platforms and 3D simulations.

Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology at **I.K.G Punjab Technical University**, I am driven to build efficient, scalable, and impactful technology.

## üöÄ What I Do

* **AI & Data Science:** I build and deploy machine learning models to solve real-world problems. My work includes developing a platform for medical anomaly detection with 95% accuracy using XGBoost and OpenCV and building AI agentic pipelines for educational platforms.
* **Full-Stack & 3D Web Development:** I create responsive and intuitive user interfaces with modern frameworks. I have experience building full-stack applications with Flask and React, and developing engaging virtual environments with Three.js to visualize complex concepts.
* **Data Visualization & Automation:** I specialize in turning raw data into actionable insights. I have built automated data pipelines for over 10,000 records, developed more than 10 dynamic dashboards using Matplotlib and Chart.js, and automated data preprocessing to reduce manual effort by 30%.
